# INR-currency-conversion
This repository focuses on converting Indian Rupee to different currencies chosen by the user.

## Code explanation
The text file currency.txt stores the exchange rates of different currencies. After reading the text file's data we are iterating over the data using the for loop and store it in a variable called 'lines'. The last step for data fetching process includes parsing the data to a dictionary called currDict.
Now in the driver code section, we take the input of the amount that the user wants to convert. Once the user inputs some amount, the list of all different currencies is displayed to the user. In the end, we convert the amount entered by the user to the selected currency for exchange. 

##Iteration
